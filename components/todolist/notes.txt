The order of the code:

-first it runs the handleMessageSubmit function when I submit a message. This
function changes the array and sends it to the flatlist where the array is rendered
in the messageItem function. Then when I press on the message in the UI, the array 
re-renders with the pressHandler function, in which the scripts state is updated.

-the array filter function takes an automatic parameter, in this case
it's called "message". This "message" parameter gets the value of
whatever the element it's iterating over is.
